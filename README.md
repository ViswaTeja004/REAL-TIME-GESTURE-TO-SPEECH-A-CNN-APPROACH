# REAL-TIME-GESTURE-TO-SPEECH-A-CNN-APPROACH
This project presents a Real-Time Sign Language Translator using Deep Learning (CNN) and OpenCV to detect and translate 250 hand gesture signs into text and speech. The system bridges communication gaps for the deaf and dumb community with accurate sign recognition and Text-to-Speech (TTS) output.
